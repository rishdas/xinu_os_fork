* Exercise 9.1:

- Demo of functionality:

xsh $ print_free
Address:0x810545e0	Length:519641632

$ hello Lucas
Hello Lucas, Welcome to the world of Xinu!!

$ print_free
Address:0x810545e0	Length:519641632

xsh $ hello Sirshak
Hello Sirshak, Welcome to the world of Xinu!!

xsh $ print_free
Address:0x810545e0	Length:519641632

* Exercise 9.4:

We  developed  an  application  called  "freemem",  that  enables  and  disables
system-wide memory unallocation. The Xinu  system boots with memory unallocation
enabled as default.

- Demo of functionality

The previous commands were done with the default unallocation procedure. Now, we
will disable memory unallocation:

xsh $ freemem --disable

xsh $ hello Lucas
Hello Lucas, Welcome to the world of Xinu!!

xsh $ print_free   
Address:0x810545e0	Length:519625248

xsh $ hello Sirshak
Hello Sirshak, Welcome to the world of Xinu!!

xsh $ print_free
Address:0x810545e0	Length:519608864

xsh $ freemem --enable

xsh $ hello Lucas
Hello Lucas, Welcome to the world of Xinu!!

xsh $ print_free
Address:0x810545e0	Length:519600672

xsh $ hello Sirshak
Hello Sirshak, Welcome to the world of Xinu!!

xsh $ print_free
Address:0x810545e0	Length:519600672

As  you  can see  above,  if  the unallocation  in  disabled,  the memory  space
available starts to decrease each time a  process is created. When it is enabled
back, the memory  space is freed back  and so we are continuing  having the sabe
amount of free memory to use.

* Exercise 9.7

We  created two  system function  called stkstamp()  and stkusedsize()  at stk.c
file.  The first function is called by create() system call to "stamp" the stack
area, from stack base to its length, with a 'mark' (STACKSTAMP). In turn, kill()
system call calls  stkusedsize() to check how many stack  locations have changed
before free the stack and terminate the process, printing the used stack size.

xsh $ help   

shell commands are:

argecho      devdump      kill         sleep        ?            freemem      
arp          echo         memdump      udp          hello        
cat          exit         memstat      udpecho      prodcons     
clear        help         ping         udpeserver   reset        
date         ipaddr       ps           uptime       print_free   
xsh $ 

Process help used 403 bytes in stack.

$ hello Sirshak
Hello Sirshak, Welcome to the world of Xinu!!
xsh $ 

Process hello used 344 bytes in stack.

xsh $ hello Lucas
Hello Lucas, Welcome to the world of Xinu!!
xsh $ 

Process hello used 342 bytes in stack.
